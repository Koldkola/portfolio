House of the Dragon — Small Canvas Game

Files:
- index.html: main HTML file. Update the title and heading with your name.
- styles.css: styles and simple HUD layout.
- game.js: game logic, audio (background music + SFX), controls.

How to run:
1. Open the folder in a browser or run a small static server. You can simply double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser.
2. For best audio autoplay behavior, click on the page or press any key to enable audio.

Controls:
- ArrowUp / ArrowDown: move the dragon up and down.
- Use the Sound button to toggle sound on/off.
- Use the Music Volume and SFX Volume sliders to adjust volumes.

Notes:
- Replace "YOUR NAME" in `index.html` with your actual name.
 - The page title and heading already use Kenechi Obiozor as the author.
- Audio uses remote assets (Pixabay / example images). If you want offline usage, download the files and update the src attributes.
- The game is intentionally small and simple. Improvements you might add: better animations, mobile controls, pause/resume, multiple levels.
